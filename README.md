# irssi-log-cleanup package

An Atom plugin that can be used to clean up irssi logs before passing them on
to other chat applications (such as Slack) when quoting.

Simply paste the log into a buffer and call the commands. It will selectively
transform the selected text, or it will transform the entire buffer if there is
no selection at current.
